# Project Improvements and Ticket Suggestions

## Project Overview

This project is a web application that functions as an online marketplace . The application enables users to buy and sell products across various categories.

### Key Features:

*   **User Authentication:** Users can create accounts and log in using Supabase.
*   **Product Browsing:** Users can browse products by category.
*   **Selling:** Users can create listings to sell their products.
*   **User Profiles:** Users have a profile page to manage their listings, favorites, and personal information.
*   **Static Pages:** The application includes informational pages on how to buy, how to sell, terms of use, etc.

## Recommended Tickets for Development

Here is a list of suggested improvements, formatted as tickets for easy transfer to GitHub Issues.

---

### High Priority

**Ticket #1: Implement Product Listing and Display**

*   **Description:** The `CategoryProducts.tsx` page currently uses mock data. This ticket involves fetching and displaying real product data from the Supabase database. This will require creating a "products" table in Supabase and writing the necessary queries to fetch the data.
*   **Files to modify:** `src/pages/CategoryProducts.tsx`, `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` (to add product-related functions).
*   **Justification:** This is a core feature of the application. Without it, users cannot see any products.

**Ticket #2: Create "Add Product" Form**

*   **Description:** The "Commencer Ã  vendre" (Start Selling) button on the `Vendre.tsx` page is not functional. This ticket involves creating a new page with a form that allows authenticated users to add new products to the marketplace. The form should include fields for title, description, price, category, and image uploads.
*   **Files to create/modify:** 
    *   Create: `src/pages/AddProduct.tsx`
    *   Modify: `src/App.tsx` (to add the new route), `src/pages/Vendre.tsx` (to link to the new page).
*   **Justification:** This is the primary way for users to add products to the marketplace, which is essential for the application's success.

**Ticket #3: Implement User Profile Functionality**

*   **Description:** The `Profile.tsx` page is mostly static. This ticket involves implementing the functionality to display the user's actual data (favorites, sales, purchases) and allowing them to update their personal information. This will require fetching and updating data from the Supabase database.
*   **Files to modify:** `src/pages/Profile.tsx`, `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`.
*   **Justification:** A functional user profile is crucial for user engagement and trust.

### Medium Priority

**Ticket #4: Refactor Authentication Logic into a Custom Hook**

*   **Description:** The authentication logic (checking for a user session, handling auth state changes) is repeated in `Vendre.tsx`, `CategoryProducts.tsx`, and `Profile.tsx`. This logic should be extracted into a custom hook (e.g., `useAuth`) to reduce code duplication and make it easier to manage authentication state across the application.
*   **Files to create/modify:**
    *   Create: `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`
    *   Modify: `src/pages/Vendre.tsx`, `src/pages/CategoryProducts.tsx`, `src/pages/Profile.tsx`.
*   **Justification:** This will improve code quality, reduce redundancy, and make the code easier to maintain.

**Ticket #5: Centralize Supabase Client**

*   **Description:** The Supabase client is initialized in `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` but could be better organized to include all Supabase-related functions (e.g., fetching products, updating profiles). This ticket involves refactoring the Supabase integration to create a more organized and reusable service.
*   **Files to modify:** `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` and all files that use the Supabase client.
*   **Justification:** This will improve the organization and maintainability of the backend integration code.

**Ticket #6: Implement "Contact Seller" Functionality**

*   **Description:** The "Contacter le vendeur" (Contact Seller) button in `CategoryProducts.tsx` currently does nothing. This ticket involves implementing a feature that allows users to contact the seller, either through an integrated chat system or by revealing the seller's contact information.
*   **Files to modify:** `src/pages/CategoryProducts.tsx`.
*   **Justification:** This is a key feature for facilitating transactions between buyers and sellers.

### Low Priority

**Ticket #7: Add Loading and Empty States**

*   **Description:** The application could benefit from more explicit loading and empty states. For example, when fetching products in `CategoryProducts.tsx`, a loading spinner should be displayed. If no products are found, a clear message should be shown.
*   **Files to modify:** `src/pages/CategoryProducts.tsx`, `src/pages/Profile.tsx`.
*   **Justification:** This will improve the user experience by providing better feedback to the user.

**Ticket #8: Improve Accessibility**

*   **Description:** A quick review of the code shows some potential accessibility issues. For example, some buttons are missing `aria-label` attributes. This ticket involves a more thorough review of the application to identify and fix accessibility issues.
*   **Files to modify:** Various component and page files.
*   **Justification:** This will make the application more usable for people with disabilities.
